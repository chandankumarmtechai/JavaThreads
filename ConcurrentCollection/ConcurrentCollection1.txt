ArrayBlockingQueue<E>
A bounded blocking queue backed by an array. This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out). 
The head of the queue is that element that has been on the queue the longest time. 
The tail of the queue is that element that has been on the queue the shortest time. 
New elements are inserted at the tail of the queue, and the queue retrieval operations obtain elements at the head of the queue.

BlockingQueue implementations are designed to be used primarily for producer-consumer queues, 
but additionally support the Collection interface.
BlockingQueue implementations are thread-safe. 
All queuing methods achieve their effects atomically using internal locks or other forms of concurrency control.
Note that a BlockingQueue can safely be used with multiple producers and multiple consumers.
